Description: Run DRPCLI in Docker Context
Documentation: Very minimal container to run the DRPCLI as a starting or idle point
  for Machines. This provides a very low overhead system to start or complete workflows
  so that tasks can continue to execute even if the target machine is not available
  (or never exists).
